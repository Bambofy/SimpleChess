SimpleChess
===========

While travelling around Europe, my friend Julius got me playing Chess A LOT. After a while I got addicted to it so i decided to program my own version of it.
It's not 100% foolproof but it's good enough for me to put up here for now. If i can be arsed later on i might come back and fix all the bugs.

Bugs
====
- Any piece can jump over another on their pass (much like in real-life but not good here...)
- Piece selection can be a bit iffy, just keep an eye on the titlebar.
